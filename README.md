# Pavan Kumar Appannagari

Software engineer interested in how systems behave — and how to make them behave consistently.

My work currently focuses on mobile platforms, while expanding into performance, data engineering, and correctness in distributed systems.

---

## What I Think About

- Architectural consistency across independently evolving systems
- Kotlin Multiplatform and cross-platform domain modeling
- Concurrency mental models (Swift Concurrency & Coroutines)
- Performance and behavioral drift in long-lived systems
- Applying AI to real software problems rather than isolated demos

---

## Writing

I write technical essays exploring how implementation details turn into system behavior.
